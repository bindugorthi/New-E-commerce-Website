E-COMMERCE WEBSITE - SIMPLE GUIDE
==========================================

WHAT WAS CREATED:
-----------------
I created a complete e-commerce website with 5 pages:

1. index.html      - Home page (main page)
2. services.html   - Services page
3. products.html   - Products page
4. cart.html       - Shopping cart page
5. contact.html    - Contact page
6. styles.css      - All the styling/design
7. script.js       - All the functionality

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Open the website:
   - Double-click on "index.html" file
   - OR right-click on "index.html" and select "Open with" -> choose your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

2. Navigate the website:
   - Click on "Home", "Services", "Products", "Cart", or "Contact" in the menu
   - All pages are connected and working

3. Shopping features:
   - Go to "Products" page to see all products
   - Click "Add to Cart" button on any product
   - Go to "Cart" page to see your items
   - You can increase/decrease quantity or remove items
   - Click "Proceed to Checkout" when ready

4. Contact form:
   - Go to "Contact" page
   - Fill out the form and click "Send Message"

WHERE ARE THE FILES:
--------------------
All files are in this folder:
C:\Users\educa\ecommerce-website\

WHAT EACH FILE DOES:
--------------------
- index.html    = The home page (start here!)
- services.html = Shows what services you offer
- products.html = Shows all products for sale
- cart.html     = Shows items in shopping cart
- contact.html  = Contact form and information
- styles.css    = Makes everything look beautiful
- script.js     = Makes buttons and cart work

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
------------------
- HTML (structure of pages)
- CSS (design and styling)
- JavaScript (interactive features)

That's it! Just open index.html in your browser to start!
